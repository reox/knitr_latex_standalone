How to do knitr and standalone?!

The key to success is to detach the preamble of knitr to a separate file!

But this has some disadvantage: The preamble of the standalone files can not be
read files.

But, you can of course create a shared preable for all the files and input it in
the preamble of each file. Make sure that you do not include the knitr preamble
in Rtex files!
